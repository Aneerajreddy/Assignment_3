1.	(Titanic Dataset) 
1.	Find the correlation between ‘survived’ (target column) and ‘sex’ column for the Titanic use case in class. a. Do you think we should keep this feature? 
2.	Do at least two visualizations to describe or show correlations.  
3.	Implement Naïve Bayes method using scikit-learn library and report the accuracy. 

 

 
 

 
2.	(Glass Dataset) 
 
1. Implement Naïve Bayes method using scikit-learn library. 
a.	Use the glass dataset available in Link also provided in your assignment. 
b.	Use train_test_split to create training and testing part. 2. Evaluate the model on testing part using score and  
classification_report(y_true, y_pred) 
 
1. Implement linear SVM method using scikit library 
a.	Use the glass dataset available in Link also provided in your assignment. 
b.	Use train_test_split to create training and testing part. 2. Evaluate the model on testing part using score and  
classification_report(y_true, y_pred) 
 
Do at least two visualizations to describe or show correlations in the Glass Dataset. 
 
Which algorithm you got better accuracy? Can you justify why?
